Project Title
Studying Diffusion and Fluid Flow for Gradient Formation in Microfluidic Platforms

Overview
This project explores the dynamics of fluid mixing and diffusion in microfluidic channels to create controlled concentration gradients. A serpentine microfluidic mixer was designed, simulated, and fabricated for biomedical and chemical mixing applications such as drug screening and lab-on-a-chip devices.

Literature Review
The design and methodology were inspired by the following research works:

Paper 1: Microfluidic systems using laminar flow splitting and recombination for static and dynamic gradients.

Paper 2: Comparative study on gradient generators including tree-shaped, Y-junction, and pressure balance systems.

Objective
To study and analyze fluid flow and diffusion-based gradient formation in a microfluidic serpentine channel, using numerical simulations and experimental validation.

Methodology
1. CAD Modelling
Designed a serpentine microchannel with two inlets and one outlet.

Dimensions: 40mm × 47mm with a total channel length of 31.75mm.

2. Simulation (ANSYS Fluent 2024 R1)
Eulerian Mixture Model for laminar flow (Re < 1).

Governing equations: Continuity, Momentum, and Species Transport (Fick's Law).

Boundary conditions: Specified inlet velocity, gauge pressure outlet.

3. Fabrication
Soft lithography using PDMS and resin mold.

Device bonded to a glass substrate.

4. Experimentation
Injected red and blue dye solutions at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min.

Observed mixing behavior and gradient formation.

Results & Analysis
Hydraulic Diameter (Dh): 204.87 µm

Reynolds Number (Re): 0.02

Peclet Number (Pe): 205 (advection-dominated transport)

Achieved uniform gradients under different inlet velocity ratios (1:1 and 1:2).

Observed anomalous diffusion behavior.

Numerical vs Analytical Hydraulic Resistance: ~6% error only.

Conclusion
A controllable concentration gradient was successfully achieved through a serpentine microfluidic design.

Simulation and experimental results confirm the role of inlet velocity in gradient slope control.

Analytical and numerical agreement shows the model's reliability.
